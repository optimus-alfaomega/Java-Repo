# Special Thanks

RealWorld would not be possible without the open source community's assistance in reviewing codebases, developing new app implementations, and a variety of other duties that help the project progress. We'd like to thank the following OSS leaders for their contributions to RealWorld:

- **Dan Abramov** (creator of Redux) for  helping [spark the initial idea](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/692009757775896577), [getting the Redux community involved](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues/1353), as well as graciously taking the time to provide feedback on the Redux codebase
- **Max Lynch** (creator of Ionic) for taking the time to provide guidance in the early days of this project
- **Addy Osmani** (creator of TodoMVC) for helping [spark the initial idea](https://twitter.com/addyosmani/status/762828483433144320) and his amazing work with TodoMVC
- **TodoMVC** ([team & contributors](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc#team)) for their exemplary & successful work; their project & org has been an invaluable analogy for us as we've built out RealWorld
- **James Brewer** (docs contributor to Django) for countless brainstorming sessions, helping name this project, and creating the Django codebase + tutorial
