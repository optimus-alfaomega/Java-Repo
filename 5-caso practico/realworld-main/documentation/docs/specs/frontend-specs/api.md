# API

This project provides you different solutions to test your frontend implementation with an API by:
- [running our official backend implementation locally](#run-the-official-backend-implementation-locally)
- [hosting your own API](#host-your-own-api)
- [using the API deployed for the official demo](#demo-api)

## Run the official backend implementation locally

The official backend implementation is open-sourced.  
You can find the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/gothinkster/node-express-prisma-v1-official-app).  
The Readme will provide you guidances to start the server locally.

:::info  
We encourage you to use this implementation's **main** branch for local tests as the **limited** one includes [limitations](#api-limitations) aimed to protect public-hosted APIs.  
:::


## Host your own API

The official backend implementation includes a [**Deploy to Heroku** button](https://github.com/gothinkster/node-express-prisma-v1-official-app#deploy-to-heroku).  
This button provides you a quick and easy way to deploy the API on Heroku for your frontend implementation.

:::caution 
The official backend implementation repository includes two branches:
- the **main** branch which adheres to the RealWorld backend specs
- the **limited** branch which includes limitations for public-hosted APIs

The **limited** branch will be more suitable if you plan to host your implementation.
[Here](#api-limitations) is the list of the limitations.
:::

## Demo API

This project provides you with a public hosted API to test your frontend implementations.  
Point your API requests to `https://api.realworld.io/api` and you're good to go!


### API Usage

The usage of the API is free and non-limited by any kind of key.

The public API is currently hosted on a free plan project on Heroku.  
If the hosted API receives no traffic in 30 minutes, it will sleep. In such a situation, there will be an additional delay on the first request.

Non-demo Articles, Tags, and Comments are deleted on a daily basis to avoid additional costs.

### Swagger documentation

The API exposes a **Swagger** documentation on `https://api.realworld.io/api-docs`.

Most of the requests require a valid token.

#### Retrieve a token

You can retrieve a token by logging in or by registering.

Log in : https://api.realworld.io/api-docs/#/User%20and%20Authentication/Login  
Register: https://api.realworld.io/api-docs/#/User%20and%20Authentication/CreateUser  

* Click the `Try it out` button
* populate the body input with the related credentials
* Click `Execute` button
* Copy the token from the response body

#### Register the token

* Click `Authorize` button on top of the Swagger documentation page
* Populate the field with `Token <generated token>`
