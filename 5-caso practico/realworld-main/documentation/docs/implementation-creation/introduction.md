# Introduction

#### Get together

Before starting a new implementation, please check if there is any [work in progress](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/discussions/categories/wip-implementations) for the stack you want to work on.  
If someone else has started working on an implementation, **consider jumping in and helping them!** by contacting the author.

Otherwise:
1. [fork our starter kit](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-starter-kit)
2. Read the followings sections: *expectations* and *features* for a better understanding of this project
3. Read the frontend and/or the backend specs
4. Submit the new implementation [here](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld)

**Get Started!**
